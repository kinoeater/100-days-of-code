**Today's Progress**: Working on a holiday card idea with html, css and Java Script

**Thoughts:** I was thinking myself is better than how I ended up today...

text bottom. I will continue tomorrow.

**Today's Progress**: Working on a holiday card idea with html, css and Java Script

**Thoughts:** Better than yesterday, I added the picture with a nice covering effect and now we can also listen to music if we hover on it. Still havinhg issues while moving the mouse off the image, music should stop, but it does not.

### Day 2: December 7, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Working on a holiday card idea with html, css and Java Script

**Thoughts:** Better than yesterday, I added the picture with a nice covering effect and now we can also listen to music if we hover on it. Music on hover works also added gif o the background. More on html an css learning

### Day 3: December 9, 2019

**Today's Progress**: New plan, decided to jump directly into angular rather than spending time on html, missing knowledge can
make the things slower but I decided to learn the missing points on the go

**Thoughts:** Bought the angular course of mosh hamedani, bought an extestion monitor.

- Angular setup
- First hello angular project and angular concepts
- Jump into type script, learn a lot of stuff in the typescrip and finished it but tomorrow want to do the same steps again.



### Day 4: December 10, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Watched the mosh's type script session once again by notting

**Thoughts:** By taking notes I better understand the OOP and typescript basics.
Th way how Mosh explains why we need the classes, coming from necessity of parameter adding to functions, interfaces... it was awesome..
