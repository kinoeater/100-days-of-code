### Day 0: December 5, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Working on a holiday card idea with html, css and Java Script

**Thoughts:** I was thinking myself is better than how I ended up today...
a lot of search on the projects, tried to imitate them. I made a flipping piture with a gloving
text bottom. I will continue tomorrow.

**Link to work:** [...)

### Day 1: December 6, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Working on a holiday card idea with html, css and Java Script

**Thoughts:** Better than yesterday, I added the picture with a nice covering effect and now we can also listen to music if we hover on it. Still havinhg issues while moving the mouse off the image, music should stop, but it does not.

### Day 2: December 7, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Working on a holiday card idea with html, css and Java Script

**Thoughts:** Better than yesterday, I added the picture with a nice covering effect and now we can also listen to music if we hover on it. Music on hover works also added gif o the background. More on html an css learning

### Day 3: December 9, 2019

**Today's Progress**: New plan, decided to jump directly into angular rather than spending time on html, missing knowledge can
make the things slower but I decided to learn the missing points on the go

**Thoughts:** Bought the angular course of mosh hamedani, bought an extestion monitor.

- Angular setup
- First hello angular project and angular concepts
- Jump into type script, learn a lot of stuff in the typescrip and finished it but tomorrow want to do the same steps again.

### Day 4: December 10, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Watched the mosh's type script session once again by notting

**Thoughts:** By taking notes I better understand the OOP and typescript basics.
Th way how Mosh explains why we need the classes, coming from necessity of parameter adding to functions, interfaces... it was awesome..

### Day 5: December 11, 2019

**Today's Progress**:
-Spend so much time with F\*ing intellisense on VsCode, finally figured it out that the problem is related to nodejs initial installation. Uninstall-reinstall with all suggssted features of nodejs resolved the intellisense (before I was not accepting to install extra nodejs features, it is downlading so much tools, which I didn't like in the first place as my computer has limited space)
-Finished typescripting basics with a very beautiful like component exercise
-Started to angular: what are the basics: first compoenent, created a componenet, registered it to a module and Add the element to html markup
-new notes on angular and notes about typescrÄ±pting

**Thoughts:** good course I am pretty satisfied with the OOP basics

### Day 6: December 12, 2019

**Today's Progress**:
-Using angularCLI for creating a component, adding the decorator, Register this new component to app module, add the element to the html markup
-Templates
-Directives
-Services

**Thoughts:** I may need to cover the same topics next time... I undersand but covering it second time will make me more confident.
